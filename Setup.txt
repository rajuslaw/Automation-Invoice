//Virtual Env Setup 
pip install virtualenv
//create Virtual env
virtualenv venv_invoice
OR
python3 -m venv venv
//Activate virtual environment
venv_invoice\Scripts\activate

//Approach 3 involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract information from unstructured text data,
such as free-form descriptions or notes in invoice documents.
One common technique for this task is Named Entity Recognition (NER).
Here's an example code using the spaCy library in Python to perform NER and extract invoice attributes:
//Install flask
pip install flask PyPDF2 pytesseract Pillow
pip install spacy
//Downlaod english launguage
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm



//CURL Command
-curl -X POST -F "file=@invoice.png" http://127.0.0.1:5000/extract_invoice_attributes
